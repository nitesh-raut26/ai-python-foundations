Python Character Set

. Letters  - A to Z, a to z 
. Digits  - 0 to 9
. Special Symbols - + - * / etc.
. Whitespaces - Blank Space, tab, carriage return, newline, formfeed
. Other Character - Python can process all ASCII and Unicode characters as part of data or literals
. 

Rules for identifiers
1. identifiers can be combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or underscore(_).
   So myVariable,variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.

2. An identifiers can not start with digit. So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid.
3. We can't use Special symbols like !,#,@,%,$ etc in our identifier.
4. Identifier can be of any length.
